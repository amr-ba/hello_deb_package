 hello (2.10-3) unstable; urgency=medium
 .
   * Add some autopkgtests. Closes: #871622.
   * Add Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser fields to debian/control. Closes: #893083.
   * Raise debhelper compat level from 9 to 13. This enables autoreconf,
     and as a result, some additional build-dependencies are required:
   - Add texinfo to Build-Depends, for a normal build.
   - Add help2man to Build-Depends, for a build using git.
   * Use secure URI in Homepage field.
   * Set upstream metadata fields Bug-Submit, Name and Repository-Browse.
   * Add upstream signing-key.
   * Use a common debian/watch file which is valid for most GNU packages.
   * Sort control fields using wrap-and-sort.
   * Update standards version to 4.6.2.
